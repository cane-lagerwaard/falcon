<ThemePreview of={[Select, Option]} />

`Select` and `Option` components render as native `<select>` and `<option>` elements with basic styling applied,
accept all of the native element props (`onChange`, `value` etc) as well as [responsive, theme-based style props](/responsive-props)
for styling purposes.

```javascript
import { Select, Option } from '@deity/falcon-ui';
```

<Playground>
  <Select>
    <Option>Choose...</Option>
    <Option>Large</Option>
    <Option>Medium</Option>
    <Option>Small</Option>
  </Select>
</Playground>
